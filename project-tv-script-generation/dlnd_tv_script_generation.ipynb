    "I tried to have all parameters as multiples of 2. Primary hyper parameter that helped make the model converge faster was the learning rate - reduced it to 0.0005 instead of 0.001 and 0.005. Additionally tried with models with 512 embed and 512 hidden dims and it took almost 1.5 times more estimating around 12 hours and with my limited compute time wouldnt be able to complete. I kept batch size to 128 so that I will be able to try our more complex models. Understood from the lectures that going more than 3 layers wouldnt add much value. I got loss ~3.5 with 20 epochs with model with 512 embed layer, the convergence in 256 was slightly quicker. My computer turned off while running the model so had to reconnect. final loss after 31(30+1 below) is ~2.9. "
